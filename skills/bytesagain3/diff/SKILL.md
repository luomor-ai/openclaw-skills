# Diff

A devtools logging and tracking toolkit. Record, search, and export entries across multiple development categories — check, validate, generate, format, lint, explain, convert, template, diff, preview, fix, and report. Each command stores timestamped entries locally and maintains a full activity history.

## Commands

### `check` — Record or view check entries

Log a check result or review recent check entries. Called with no arguments, shows the last 20 entries.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh check "build passed for commit abc123"
bash scripts/script.sh check "unit tests: 42 passed, 0 failed"
bash scripts/script.sh check
```

### `validate` — Record or view validation entries

Log validation results (schema checks, input validation, data integrity).

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh validate "JSON schema valid against draft-07"
bash scripts/script.sh validate "input validation: 3 fields missing constraints"
bash scripts/script.sh validate
```

### `generate` — Record or view generation entries

Track code generation, scaffold creation, or output generation tasks.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh generate "generated TypeScript types from GraphQL schema"
bash scripts/script.sh generate "scaffolded new microservice: order-processor"
```

### `format` — Record or view formatting entries

Log code formatting operations.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh format "ran gofmt on pkg/ — 8 files reformatted"
bash scripts/script.sh format
```

### `lint` — Record or view lint entries

Track linting results and code quality checks.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh lint "golangci-lint: 0 errors, 2 warnings"
bash scripts/script.sh lint "shellcheck: all scripts clean"
```

### `explain` — Record or view explanation entries

Save explanations of code behavior, error messages, or design decisions.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh explain "diff algorithm: Myers O(ND) used for line-level comparison"
bash scripts/script.sh explain "merge conflict in config.yaml — both branches added same key"
```

### `convert` — Record or view conversion entries

Track format conversions and data transformations.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh convert "converted unified diff to side-by-side format"
bash scripts/script.sh convert "transformed XML config to YAML"
```

### `template` — Record or view template entries

Log template creation or usage.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh template "created diff report template for PR reviews"
bash scripts/script.sh template "applied changelog template to release notes"
```

### `diff` — Record or view diff entries

Track diff comparisons and change summaries.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh diff "config v1 vs v2: 3 keys added, 1 removed, 2 changed"
bash scripts/script.sh diff "schema migration: 5 columns added across 3 tables"
```

### `preview` — Record or view preview entries

Log preview/dry-run results before applying changes.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh preview "merge preview: 12 files changed, 3 conflicts detected"
bash scripts/script.sh preview "patch dry-run: applies cleanly to target branch"
```

### `fix` — Record or view fix entries

Track bug fixes and patches.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh fix "resolved merge conflict in routes.ts"
bash scripts/script.sh fix "patched off-by-one in line number calculation"
```

### `report` — Record or view report entries

Log report generation or summary observations.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh report "PR diff summary: +342 -128 across 14 files"
bash scripts/script.sh report "weekly change report: 23 commits, 8 PRs merged"
```

### `stats` — Summary statistics

Show entry counts per category, total entries, data size, and earliest recorded activity.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh stats
```

### `export` — Export all data

Export all logged entries to JSON, CSV, or plain text format.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh export json
bash scripts/script.sh export csv
bash scripts/script.sh export txt
```

### `search` — Search across all entries

Search all log files for a keyword (case-insensitive).

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh search "merge"
bash scripts/script.sh search "conflict"
```

### `recent` — View recent activity

Show the last 20 entries from the global activity history.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh recent
```

### `status` — Health check

Display version, data directory, total entries, disk usage, and last activity timestamp.

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh status
```

### `help` / `version`

```bash
bash scripts/script.sh help
bash scripts/script.sh version
```

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in `~/.local/share/diff/`:

- **Per-command logs:** `check.log`, `validate.log`, `generate.log`, `format.log`, `lint.log`, `explain.log`, `convert.log`, `template.log`, `diff.log`, `preview.log`, `fix.log`, `report.log`
- **Activity history:** `history.log` — global log of all operations with timestamps
- **Exports:** `export.json`, `export.csv`, or `export.txt` (generated on demand)

Each entry is stored as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|<value>` with pipe-delimited fields.

## Requirements

- **bash 4+**
- **grep, wc, du, tail, head, cat, date, basename** (standard coreutils)
- No external dependencies

## When to Use

1. **Code review documentation** — Use `check`, `validate`, and `report` to log PR review findings and change summaries
2. **Change tracking** — Record file and schema diffs with `diff` to maintain a history of what changed and when
3. **Merge conflict resolution** — Log conflicts found (`preview`), how they were resolved (`fix`), and explanations (`explain`)
4. **Release management** — Track formatting, linting, and validation before each release with a full audit trail
5. **Template-driven workflows** — Use `template` and `generate` to log scaffolding and code generation across projects

## Examples

```bash
# Log a code review workflow
bash scripts/script.sh check "PR #301: all tests passing"
bash scripts/script.sh lint "eslint clean, no new warnings"
bash scripts/script.sh diff "PR #301: +89 -23 across 5 files"
bash scripts/script.sh report "approved PR #301 with minor suggestions"

# Track a merge conflict resolution
bash scripts/script.sh preview "merge develop→main: 2 conflicts in api/routes.ts"
bash scripts/script.sh fix "resolved conflict: kept develop version of auth middleware"
bash scripts/script.sh explain "conflict caused by parallel refactor of auth flow"

# View stats and export
bash scripts/script.sh stats
bash scripts/script.sh export json

# Search for historical entries
bash scripts/script.sh search "conflict"
bash scripts/script.sh recent
```
