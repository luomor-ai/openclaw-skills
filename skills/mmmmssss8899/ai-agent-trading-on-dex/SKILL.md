description: Interact with the Superior Trade API to backtest and deploy trading strategies on Superior Trade's managed cloud — no coding required from the user. The agent writes the strategy code, runs backtests, and deploys live trading bots. Use when the user wants to create, backtest, or deploy trading strategies, monitor deployments, or check backtest results. Requires one credential — an API key (x-api-key header) obtained by logging in at https://account.superior.trade. No private keys, seed phrases, or wallet credentials are ever collected from the user — wallet management is handled entirely server-side.

# Superior Trade API

API client skill for backtesting and deploying Freqtrade strategies on Superior Trade's cloud infrastructure.

**Base URL:** `https://api.superior.trade`
**Auth:** `x-api-key` header on all protected endpoints
**Docs:** `GET /docs` (Swagger UI), `GET /openapi.json` (OpenAPI spec)

## Getting an API Key

Users get their API key by logging in to the Superior Trade account portal (https://account.superior.trade). On login, an API key is automatically created and displayed.

If the user already has a key (prefixed `st_live_`), use it directly in the `x-api-key` header.

If the user doesn't have a key yet, direct them to log in at https://account.superior.trade — the key is created automatically on first login.

## Security & Permissions

### Only Credential: API Key

This skill requires exactly **one credential**: an `x-api-key` header value. The key is obtained by logging in at [account.superior.trade](https://account.superior.trade) — no manual creation step is needed.

**The agent must NEVER ask users for private keys, seed phrases, or wallet credentials.** All wallet/key management is handled server-side by the platform. The only secret the user provides is their API key.

### API Key Scope

The API key grants access **only** to the authenticated user's own resources:

| Can do | Cannot do |
|--------|-----------|
| Create, list, delete backtests | Access other users' data |
| Create, start, stop, delete deployments | Withdraw funds from any wallet |
| Store credentials (server-managed wallets) | Export or view private keys |
| View deployment logs and status | Modify platform infrastructure |
| Read wallet address metadata | Transfer funds between wallets |

The key is scoped to backtesting and deployment operations. It cannot initiate withdrawals or access private key material.

### Transparency Requirements

Before any **live deployment** (not paper trading), the agent MUST present a human-readable summary and wait for explicit user confirmation:

```
Deployment Summary:
- Strategy: [name]
- Exchange: hyperliquid
- Trading mode: [spot/futures]
- Pairs: [list]
- Stake amount: [amount] USDC per trade
- Max open trades: [n]
- Stoploss: [percentage]
- Margin mode: [cross/isolated] (futures only)

⚠️ This will trade with REAL funds. Proceed? (yes/no)
```

The agent must NOT start a live deployment without receiving an explicit affirmative response from the user.

If the user asks to see the raw API request or payload at any point, the agent must show it — transparency is always available on request.

## Supported Exchanges

| Exchange    | Stake Currencies | Trading Modes |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Hyperliquid | USDC             | spot, futures |

### Hyperliquid Notes

**Pair format differs by trading mode** (follows CCXT convention):

- **Spot**: `BTC/USDC` (base/quote)
- **Futures/Perp**: `BTC/USDC:USDC` (base/quote:settle)

**Spot limitations:**

- Stoploss on exchange is NOT supported — the bot handles stoploss internally
- No market orders (ccxt simulates via limit orders with up to 5% slippage)

**Futures capabilities:**

- Margin modes: `"isolated"` and `"cross"`
- Stoploss on exchange supported via `stop-loss-limit` orders
- No market orders (same simulation as spot)

**Data availability:**

- Hyperliquid API only provides ~5000 historic candles per pair
- Historic OHLCV bulk download is not supported via the exchange API
- Superior Trade infrastructure pre-downloads data; availability starts from approximately November 2025

**Hyperliquid is a DEX** — it does not use traditional API key/secret authentication. Instead, it uses wallet-based signing. Wallet credentials are managed automatically by the platform (see "Hyperliquid Credentials" section below).

### HIP3 — Tokenized Real-World Assets

Hyperliquid supports **HIP3** tokenized assets — stocks, commodities, currencies, and indices — tradeable as perpetual futures. These are fetched directly from the Hyperliquid API and available in Superior Trade's pre-downloaded data.

**Pair format** follows CCXT convention with a protocol prefix: `{PROTOCOL}-{TICKER}/USDC:USDC`

**Available protocols and example pairs:**

| Protocol | Asset Types | Stake Currency | Example Pairs (config format) |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| `XYZ-` | US/KR stocks, metals, currencies, indices | USDC | `XYZ-AAPL/USDC:USDC`, `XYZ-TSLA/USDC:USDC`, `XYZ-GOLD/USDC:USDC` |
| `CASH-` | Commodities, stocks | USDT0 | `CASH-GOLD/USDT0:USDT0`, `CASH-GOOGL/USDT0:USDT0` |
| `FLX-` | Commodities, stocks, crypto | USDC or USDH | `FLX-GOLD/USDH:USDH`, `FLX-TSLA/USDH:USDH` |
| `KM-` | Stocks, indices, bonds | USDH | `KM-GOOGL/USDH:USDH`, `KM-US500/USDH:USDH` |
| `HYNA-` | Leveraged crypto | USDC or USDE | `HYNA-SOL/USDE:USDE`, `HYNA-XRP/USDC:USDC` |

**XYZ protocol tickers** (USDC — most commonly used):
- **US stocks**: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA, NFLX, HOOD, PLTR, INTC, RIVN, COIN, SNDK, BABA
- **Metals**: GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, PLATINUM, PALLADIUM
- **Currencies**: JPY
- **Indices**: XYZ100
- **Korean stocks**: HYUNDAI, SKHX, SMSN

**Data availability:**
- XYZ assets: data from ~November 2025 onwards
- KM/CASH/FLX assets: data from ~February 2026 onwards
- Timeframes: 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h (also 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 1d, 3d, 1w for some)
- Funding rate data available at 1h timeframe

**Trading considerations:**
- HIP3 assets are **futures-only** — always use `trading_mode: "futures"` and `margin_mode: "cross"`
- XYZ pairs use `stake_currency: "USDC"` — works with existing USDC balances
- USDH/USDT0/USDE pairs require the corresponding stake currency
- Stock-based HIP3 assets may have reduced liquidity outside US market hours
- Use the same strategy code patterns as regular crypto futures — no special handling needed

**Config example (XYZ-AAPL futures):**
```json
{
  "exchange": { "name": "hyperliquid", "pair_whitelist": ["XYZ-AAPL/USDC:USDC"] },
  "stake_currency": "USDC",
  "stake_amount": 100,
  "timeframe": "15m",
  "max_open_trades": 3,
  "stoploss": -0.05,
  "trading_mode": "futures",
  "margin_mode": "cross",
  "entry_pricing": { "price_side": "other" },
  "exit_pricing": { "price_side": "other" },
  "pairlists": [{ "method": "StaticPairList" }]
}
```

### Unified vs Legacy Account Mode

Hyperliquid accounts may run in **unified mode** (single balance for spot + perps) or **legacy mode** (separate balances). Do NOT assume which mode the user has.

- If perps `clearinghouseState` shows $0 but `spotClearinghouseState` shows funds, ask the user if they have unified mode enabled before advising a transfer.
- If the user confirms unified mode, spot USDC is automatically available as perps collateral — no transfer needed.

## Verification-First Principle

Every factual claim about the user's account, balance, wallet status, or deployment health MUST be backed by an API call made in the current conversation turn. The pattern is:

1. Make the API call
2. Read the response
3. Report the data

**NEVER:** assume → report → verify later. **ALWAYS:** verify → report.

## Agent Behavior

The agent should make API calls directly and present results conversationally rather than dumping raw curl commands or JSON payloads. If the user asks to see the raw request, response, or payload, always show it — transparency on request is mandatory.

- **Backtesting**: The agent builds the config and strategy code from the user's intent, calls the API, starts the backtest, polls for completion, and presents results — all automatically.
- **Deployment**: The agent creates the deployment, stores credentials via the API (automatic — no user input needed), and starts the bot. Always show the deployment summary (see Transparency Requirements above) and get explicit confirmation before starting a live bot.
- **Proactive information gathering**: If the agent needs info (e.g. which pair, timeframe, stake amount), ask the user directly. Don't present a wall of required fields — ask conversationally, one concern at a time.
- **After backtesting**: If results are poor (negative profit), warn the user before offering to deploy live. If results are good, offer to deploy and begin gathering what's needed.

### Anti-Hallucination — Balance & State Checks

NEVER report a wallet balance, account state, or API result without making the actual API call first. If you cannot call the API, say "I haven't checked yet" — do not guess or assume. Every number you present must come from a real API response in the current session.

To check Hyperliquid balances, use these calls:

- **Perps:** `POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info` → `{"type":"clearinghouseState","user":"0x..."}`
- **Spot:** `POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info` → `{"type":"spotClearinghouseState","user":"0x..."}`

Always call BOTH endpoints and report combined results.

### Hyperliquid Credentials

Credentials are managed automatically through the platform — users do **not** need to create agent wallets on Hyperliquid manually.

When a deployment needs exchange credentials, the v2 credentials endpoint handles wallet creation and key management server-side. The agent only needs to call `POST /v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` with the exchange name.

Two modes are available:

1. **Auto wallet (default)**: Omit `wallet_address` — the server creates or finds a platform-managed wallet for the user. The wallet is owned by the server and its private key is never exposed to the user.

2. **User-provided wallet**: Pass `wallet_address` with the user's existing Hyperliquid wallet address. The server validates ownership and exports the key. The wallet must be a platform-managed embedded wallet.

**The agent must NEVER ask users for private keys.** All key management is handled server-side. The agent should default to auto-wallet mode (omit `wallet_address`) unless the user specifically requests a particular wallet.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "status": "running | stopped | ...",
  "replicas": 1,
  "available_replicas": 1,
  "pods": null
}
```

### POST `/v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` — Store Credentials (v2 Privy-only)

**Request (Hyperliquid):**

`exchange` is required. `wallet_address` is optional. `private_key` is **NOT accepted** — keys are managed server-side.

Two modes:

1. **Auto wallet (default)**: Omit `wallet_address` — a platform-managed wallet is created or found for the user. Response includes `wallet_source: "main_trading_wallet"`.
2. **User-provided wallet**: Pass `wallet_address` with the user's existing wallet. Ownership is validated server-side. Response includes `wallet_source: "provided"`.

```json
{
  "exchange": "hyperliquid",
  "wallet_address": "0x... (optional — user's wallet address)"
}
```

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "credentials_status": "stored",
  "exchange": "hyperliquid",
  "wallet_address": "0x...",
  "wallet_source": "main_trading_wallet | provided",
  "updated_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Error responses:**
- `400 invalid_request` — `private_key` was sent (not accepted in v2)
- `400 invalid_wallet_address` — invalid Ethereum address format
- `400 duplicate_wallet_address` — wallet is already used by another deployment
- `400 unsupported_exchange` — only `"hyperliquid"` is supported
- `400 no_wallet_available` — no platform-managed wallet available for the user
- `403 wallet_not_owned` — user does not own the provided wallet address
- `500 server_misconfigured` — server wallet configuration issue
- If credentials are already `"stored"`, the endpoint returns the existing status (idempotent)

#### Credential Updates (CRITICAL)

The `POST /v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` endpoint is **idempotent once credentials are stored** — it will NOT overwrite existing credentials. To change wallets on a running deployment:

1. Stop: `PUT /v2/deployment/{id}/status` → `{"action":"stop"}`
2. Delete: `DELETE /v2/deployment/{id}`
3. Create new: `POST /v2/deployment`
4. Store new credentials: `POST /v2/deployment/{id}/credentials`
5. Start: `PUT /v2/deployment/{id}/status` → `{"action":"start"}`

NEVER tell the user "credentials updated" after calling the endpoint — always read the response and confirm the new wallet address was actually stored.

### GET `/v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` — Credential Info

Returns wallet metadata for a deployment. Does NOT return private keys.

**Response (200 — credentials stored):**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "credentials_status": "stored",
  "exchange": "hyperliquid",
  "wallet_address": "0x...",
  "wallet_source": "main_trading_wallet | provided",
  "wallet_type": "main_wallet | agent_wallet"
}
```

**Response (200 — no credentials):**

```json
{ "credentials_status": "missing" }
```

### GET `/v2/deployment/{id}/logs`

Query params: `pageSize` (default 100), `pageToken`.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "string",
  "items": [{ "timestamp": "ISO8601", "message": "string", "severity": "string" }],
  "nextCursor": "string | null"
}
```

### DELETE `/v2/deployment/{id}`

**Response (200):**

```json
{ "message": "Deployment deleted" }
```

### Paginated List

Both `GET /v2/backtesting` and `GET /v2/deployment` return:

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "nextCursor": "string | null"
}
```

Pagination is cursor-based. Pass `cursor` query param with the `nextCursor` value to fetch the next page.

### Error Responses

**401 — Unauthorized (missing or invalid API key):**

```json
{
  "message": "No API key found in request",
  "request_id": "string"
}
```

**400 — Validation error:**

```json
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "message": "Invalid request",
  "details": [{ "path": "field", "message": "validation error" }]
}
```

**404 — Not found:**

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "Backtest not found"
}
```

## Config Reference

The `config` object is a Freqtrade configuration. Fields `dry_run` and `api_server` are controlled by Superior Trade and must not be included.

### Spot Config

Spot pairs use `BTC/USDC` format. Note: stoploss on exchange is not supported for spot.

```json
{
  "exchange": { "name": "hyperliquid", "pair_whitelist": ["BTC/USDC"] },
  "stake_currency": "USDC",
  "stake_amount": 100,
  "timeframe": "5m",
  "max_open_trades": 3,
  "stoploss": -0.1,
  "pairlists": [{ "method": "StaticPairList" }]
}
```

### Futures Config (recommended)

Futures/perp pairs use `BTC/USDC:USDC` format (base/quote:settle). Requires `trading_mode` and `margin_mode`.

```json
{
  "exchange": { "name": "hyperliquid", "pair_whitelist": ["BTC/USDC:USDC"] },
  "stake_currency": "USDC",
  "stake_amount": 100,

## Strategy Code Template

The `code` field must be valid Python containing a Freqtrade `IStrategy` subclass. The class name must end with `Strategy` and follow PascalCase.

Use `import talib.abstract as ta` for technical indicators (talib is pre-installed in the runtime).

```python
from freqtrade.strategy import IStrategy
import pandas as pd
import talib.abstract as ta


class MyCustomStrategy(IStrategy):
    minimal_roi = {
        "0": 0.10,
        "30": 0.05,
        "120": 0.02
    }

    stoploss = -0.10
    trailing_stop = False
    timeframe = '5m'
    process_only_new_candles = True
    startup_candle_count = 20

    def populate_indicators(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame, metadata: dict) -> pd.DataFrame:
        dataframe['rsi'] = ta.RSI(dataframe, timeperiod=14)
        dataframe['sma_20'] = ta.SMA(dataframe, timeperiod=20)
        return dataframe

    def populate_entry_trend(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame, metadata: dict) -> pd.DataFrame:
        dataframe.loc[
            (dataframe['rsi'] < 30) &
            (dataframe['close'] > dataframe['sma_20']),
            'enter_long'
        ] = 1
        return dataframe

    def populate_exit_trend(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame, metadata: dict) -> pd.DataFrame:
        dataframe.loc[
            (dataframe['rsi'] > 70),
            'exit_long'
        ] = 1
        return dataframe
```

**Requirements for `code`:**

- Must `import` from `freqtrade`
- Must `import talib.abstract as ta` for technical indicators (do NOT use `self.indicators`)
- Must define a class inheriting from `IStrategy` with a PascalCase name ending in `Strategy`
- Must implement `populate_indicators`, `populate_entry_trend`, and `populate_exit_trend`

### Multi-Output TA-Lib Functions (CRITICAL)

Some TA-Lib abstract functions return a **DataFrame with multiple columns**, not a single Series. Assigning them directly to one column causes a runtime error that only appears during the backtest — not at validation time.

**These functions return multiple columns — do NOT assign directly to a single column:**

| Function       | Returns                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `ta.BBANDS`    | `upperband`, `middleband`, `lowerband`   |
| `ta.MACD`      | `macd`, `macdsignal`, `macdhist`         |
| `ta.STOCH`     | `slowk`, `slowd`                         |
| `ta.STOCHF`    | `fastk`, `fastd`                         |
| `ta.STOCHRSI`  | `fastk`, `fastd`                         |
| `ta.AROON`     | `aroondown`, `aroonup`                   |
| `ta.HT_PHASOR` | `inphase`, `quadrature`                  |
| `ta.MAMA`      | `mama`, `fama`                           |
| `ta.MINMAXINDEX`| `minidx`, `maxidx`                      |

```python
# WRONG — causes runtime crash (shape mismatch)
dataframe["bb_upper"] = ta.BBANDS(dataframe, timeperiod=20)
dataframe["macd"] = ta.MACD(dataframe)

# CORRECT — assign each column separately
bb = ta.BBANDS(dataframe, timeperiod=20)
dataframe["bb_upper"] = bb["upperband"]
dataframe["bb_middle"] = bb["middleband"]
dataframe["bb_lower"] = bb["lowerband"]

macd = ta.MACD(dataframe)
dataframe["macd"] = macd["macd"]
dataframe["macd_signal"] = macd["macdsignal"]
dataframe["macd_hist"] = macd["macdhist"]

stoch = ta.STOCH(dataframe)
dataframe["slowk"] = stoch["slowk"]
dataframe["slowd"] = stoch["slowd"]
```

**Single-output functions** (RSI, SMA, EMA, ATR, ADX, etc.) return a Series and can be assigned directly:
```python
dataframe["rsi"] = ta.RSI(dataframe, timeperiod=14)  # OK — returns Series
```

### One Open Trade Per Pair & DCA

Freqtrade enforces a **one open trade per pair** rule. Once a trade is open on a pair (e.g. `BTC/USDC:USDC`), all subsequent entry signals for that pair are ignored until the trade is closed — even if the strategy generates a signal every candle.

This means strategies that rely on buying repeatedly into the same pair (e.g. "buy $500 BTC every minute for an hour") will only execute the **first** entry. The rest are silently dropped.

**To implement DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) or position scaling**, use the `adjust_trade_position()` callback instead of generating new entry signals:

```python
def adjust_trade_position(self, trade, current_time, current_rate,
                         current_profit, min_stake, max_stake,
                         current_entry_rate, current_exit_rate,
                         current_entry_profit, current_exit_profit,
                         **kwargs):
    # Return a positive stake amount to add to the position (DCA buy)
    # Return a negative stake amount to partially close the position
    # Return None to do nothing
    #
    # IMPORTANT: Hyperliquid exchange minimum is $10 per order.
    # Freqtrade inflates this by a stoploss reserve (up to 1.5×), making
    # the effective minimum $10–$15 depending on stoploss depth.
    # Always check min_stake and ensure amounts >= min_stake.
    if should_dca(trade, current_time):
        dca_amount = 500  # add $500 to the position
        return max(dca_amount, min_stake)  # respect exchange minimum
    return None
```

Key points:
- `adjust_trade_position()` is called on every candle while a trade is open
- Returning a positive number opens an additional order (DCA buy)
- Returning a negative number partially closes the position
- The agent should use this pattern whenever the user wants repeated buys on the same pair
- `max_open_trades` in config limits total concurrent trades across all pairs, not entries per pair
- **Hyperliquid minimum order: $10 (exchange base).** Freqtrade applies a stoploss reserve on top: `$10 × min(1.05 / (1 - |stoploss|), 1.5)`, making the effective minimum $10–$15 depending on stoploss depth (e.g. $15 at -30% stoploss). Always use the `min_stake` parameter — it already accounts for this reserve. Superior Trade auto-sets `trading_min_order_amount: 10` in config. The API validates at deployment time that `stake_amount` ≥ effective minimum for the configured stoploss, so bad configs are rejected early with a clear error message.

## Typical Workflows

### Backtest Workflow

The agent should execute all these steps automatically, presenting only the final results to the user:

1. Build config and strategy code from the user's requirements
2. `POST /v2/backtesting` — create the backtest
3. `PUT /v2/backtesting/{id}/status` with `{"action": "start"}` — start it
4. Poll `GET /v2/backtesting/{id}/status` every 10s until `completed` or `failed` (typically 1-10 minutes)
5. `GET /v2/backtesting/{id}` — fetch full results; download `result_url` for detailed JSON
6. Present a summary: total trades, win rate, profit, drawdown, sharpe ratio
7. If failed, check `GET /v2/backtesting/{id}/logs` and report the issue
8. To stop a running backtest: `DELETE /v2/backtesting/{id}`

### Pre-Deployment Checklist (MANDATORY before starting any live bot)

Before calling `PUT /v2/deployment/{id}/status` → `{"action":"start"}`, verify ALL of these:

1. **Credentials are stored** — `GET /v2/deployment/{id}` and confirm `credentials_status` is `"stored"`. If not, call `POST /v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` first.

2. **Funds are available** — Check BOTH perps and spot balances on the user's wallet. Use `GET /v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` to find the `wallet_address`, then check via `POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info` → `{"type":"clearinghouseState","user":"<WALLET_ADDRESS>"}` and `{"type":"spotClearinghouseState","user":"<WALLET_ADDRESS>"}`. Report what you find. If funds are only in spot and user doesn't have unified mode, advise transfer.

3. **Pair is tradeable** — `POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info` → `{"type":"meta"}` and verify the pair exists in the `universe` array.

Do NOT skip any step. Do NOT assume any step passed without making the actual API call.

### Deployment Workflow

The agent should handle the API calls and proactively ask the user for what's needed:

1. `POST /v2/deployment` with config, code, name — create the deployment
2. **For live trading:** store credentials via the platform:
   - `POST /v2/deployment/{id}/credentials` with `{ "exchange": "hyperliquid" }` — the server creates/finds a wallet automatically
   - Optionally, if the user wants to use a specific wallet: `{ "exchange": "hyperliquid", "wallet_address": "0x..." }`
   - No manual wallet creation is needed — the platform handles it
3. **For paper trading:** credentials are optional — skip them. The deployment will run in dry-run mode automatically.
4. Run pre-deployment checklist (see above)
5. **MANDATORY: Show deployment summary** (see Transparency Requirements) and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding. Do NOT auto-start live deployments.
6. `PUT /v2/deployment/{id}/status` with `{"action": "start"}` — start (live if credentials stored, paper/dry-run if not)
6. Monitor with `GET /v2/deployment/{id}/status`
7. Check logs with `GET /v2/deployment/{id}/logs`
8. Stop with `PUT /v2/deployment/{id}/status` `{"action": "stop"}`

### Reporting DCA / Multi-Order Trades

When a strategy uses `adjust_trade_position()` (DCA, scaling, or any multi-order pattern), the agent MUST follow these reporting rules:

**Rule 1 — Distinguish trades from orders.** A single "trade" in backtest results may contain many buy/sell orders. Never report raw trade count alone when DCA is used. Always clarify: "X trades (Y total buy orders, Z total sell orders)".

**Rule 2 — Show per-order detail.** For at least the first completed trade, provide:
- Number of buy orders and sell orders
- First buy price and last buy price
- Weighted average entry price and weighted average exit price
- Total position size accumulated across all DCA orders

**Rule 3 — Flag order-level issues.** Report any of the following if they occur:
- Minimum order size rejections (order too small for the exchange)
- Rate limit or API failures on individual orders
- Dust positions remaining after final sell
- Expected vs actual order count mismatches (e.g., strategy intended 10 DCA buys but only 7 executed)

**Rule 4 — Skip the breakdown for non-DCA strategies.** If the strategy uses a simple 1 buy + 1 sell pattern (no `adjust_trade_position()`), standard trade-level reporting is sufficient — no per-order breakdown needed.

**Rule 5 — Always download `result_url` for full order-level data.** The summary endpoint does not include individual order details. The agent must download the `result_url` JSON and parse `orders` within each trade to provide accurate DCA reporting.

### Important Notes

- Credentials are **optional**. If `credentialsStatus` is `"stored"`, the deployment runs **live**; if missing, it runs in **paper (dry-run)** mode with no real trades
- Each deployment runs as an isolated container
- Backtests run as jobs and are cleaned up after completion
- Config fields `dry_run` and `api_server` are managed by Superior Trade; do not include them
- Hyperliquid pair format depends on trading mode: spot uses `BTC/USDC`, futures uses `BTC/USDC:USDC` — using the wrong format for the mode will cause "not tradable" errors
- Futures mode requires `trading_mode: "futures"` and `margin_mode: "cross"` (or `"isolated"`) in config
- Spot mode does NOT support stoploss on exchange; futures mode supports `stop-loss-limit` orders
- Historical data for Hyperliquid is available from approximately November 2025 onwards; choose timeranges within the available data window
- Backtests with no available data for the requested timerange will fail — check logs for details
- Backtest status supports `"start"` and `"stop"` — stop cancels a running/pending backtest
- Deployment status actions are `"start"` / `"stop"`
- Response timestamps use snake_case: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`
- All endpoints use the `/v2/` prefix with `x-api-key` authentication
